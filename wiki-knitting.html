        <div class="section" id="introduction">
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Welcome to this knitting information page. Here you will find detailed explanations of various knitting stitches and techniques.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="Kitchener">
            <h1>Kitchener</h1>
            <p>The Kitchener stitch is a finishing technique used in knitting to create an invisible, seamless join between two sets of live stitches, often used for grafting sock toes, shoulders, or other pieces. It involves weaving yarn through the stitches with a tapestry needle in a specific sequence that mimics the knit and purl structure, ensuring the join looks like continuous knitting. This technique is valued for its polished and professional appearance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="Cable">
            <h1>Cable</h1>
            <p>The cable stitch is a knitting technique used to create a twisted or braided texture on the fabric. It involves temporarily transferring a group of stitches to a cable needle, holding them to the front or back of the work, and then knitting the next stitches before returning to the held stitches. This process creates the appearance of intertwining strands, commonly used in patterns for sweaters, hats, and scarves. Cable stitches add depth and dimension, making them a popular choice for decorative knitting projects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="Garter">
            <h1>Garter</h1>
            <p>The garter stitch is one of the simplest and most basic knitting stitches, created by knitting every row (or purling every row) when working flat. It produces a fabric with a ridged, textured appearance that is stretchy and lays flat without curling. Garter stitch is highly versatile, often used in scarves, blankets, and edges of garments due to its simplicity and clean look. It's an excellent choice for beginners or projects that require a sturdy and visually appealing texture.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="Stockinette">
            <h1>Stockinette</h1>
            <p>The stockinette stitch is a classic knitting pattern that alternates between knit stitches on the right side and purl stitches on the wrong side when worked flat. It creates a smooth, even fabric on the front (right side) with a "v" pattern, while the back (wrong side) has a bumpy texture. Stockinette stitch is commonly used in garments and accessories, as it drapes well and is visually clean. However, it tends to curl at the edges, so itâ€™s often paired with a border like garter or ribbing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="Seed">
            <h1>Seed</h1>
            <p>The seed stitch is a textured knitting pattern created by alternating knit and purl stitches in a specific sequence. Typically, it involves knitting one stitch, then purling the next, but the pattern shifts every row to maintain a staggered, seed-like appearance. This stitch creates a dense, bumpy texture that is reversible and lays flat, making it ideal for scarves, blankets, and edges of garments. Seed stitch is known for its flexibility, visual interest, and ability to prevent fabric from curling.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="GarterRibbing">
            <h1>Garter Ribbing</h1>
            <p>Garter ribbing is a combination of garter stitch and ribbing that creates a stretchy, textured fabric. It typically involves alternating knit and purl stitches in a pattern, but with the added twist of working the knit stitches in the round or in a flat piece, which creates a subtle ribbed effect while maintaining the ridges of the garter stitch. This stitch provides a flexible, elastic fabric that's commonly used for cuffs, edges, and accessories like hats or scarves, offering both texture and a snug fit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="BrokenRib">
            <h1>Broken Rib</h1>
            <p>The broken rib stitch is a textured knitting pattern that combines elements of ribbing with alternating knit and purl stitches, but with the pattern interrupted by non-repeating rows. It typically alternates between a few rows of standard ribbing (like knit 2, purl 2) and a row where the purls and knits are staggered or switched, giving the fabric a "broken" look. This stitch creates a stretchy, textured fabric with a subtle, irregular pattern, often used for scarves, sweaters, and cuffs to add visual interest without the firmness of traditional ribbing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="Sand">
            <h1>Sand</h1>
            <p>The sand stitch is a textured knitting pattern that creates a soft, bumpy effect resembling grains of sand. It is typically worked by alternating knit and purl stitches in a specific sequence, often in a two-stitch or four-stitch repeat. This creates a fabric with a subtle, uneven texture that is both visually interesting and comfortable. Sand stitch is often used for scarves, blankets, and other accessories, as it provides both structure and a gentle, tactile feel. It is similar to seed stitch but with a more uniform and slightly gentler texture.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="BeadedRib">
            <h1>Beaded Rib</h1>
            <p>The beaded rib stitch is a decorative knitting pattern that combines the structure of ribbing with beads or other embellishments, adding texture and visual interest to the fabric. Typically, it involves knitting and purling in a ribbing pattern, with beads being added at specific intervals or stitches within the pattern. The beads are usually threaded onto the yarn before being knitted into place, creating small, raised bumps that add a touch of sparkle or texture. This stitch is commonly used for scarves, shawls, and accessories where a bit of flair is desired.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="SeededRib">
            <h1>Seeded Rib</h1>
            <p>The seeded rib stitch is a textured knitting pattern that combines the structure of ribbing with the bumpy texture of seed stitch. It typically alternates between knit and purl stitches in a staggered manner, creating a ribbed effect, while the purls are placed in such a way that they form a "seeded" or bumpy texture. This stitch creates a fabric that is stretchy, textured, and visually interesting, offering a subtle, woven look. Seeded rib is often used for scarves, cuffs, and edges, providing a neat, elastic finish without the curling tendency of traditional stockinette.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="DoubleMoss">
            <h1>Double Moss</h1>
            <p>The double moss stitch is a textured knitting pattern that creates a dense, bumpy fabric with a balanced, woven appearance. It involves alternating knit and purl stitches in a specific sequence, typically using two knit stitches and two purl stitches in a staggered pattern. The pattern is worked in a repeat every few rows, with the position of the knit and purl stitches shifting each row to create a textured effect. The double moss stitch is thicker and more textured than single moss stitch, making it ideal for scarves, blankets, and other accessories where a durable, tactile texture is desired.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="IrishMoss">
            <h1>Irish Moss</h1>
            <p>The Irish moss stitch is a textured knitting pattern that combines knit and purl stitches to create a dense, slightly raised pattern. It typically involves alternating knit and purl stitches within a row, with the pattern shifting every few rows to create a staggered, moss-like effect. This stitch creates a fabric with subtle texture and a reversible pattern, making it suitable for scarves, blankets, and other accessories. The Irish moss stitch is known for its clean, structured look, providing both elasticity and visual interest without curling at the edges.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="PerlRidge">
            <h1>Perl Ridge</h1>
            <p>The Perl Ridge stitch is a textured knitting pattern that creates a series of ridges on the fabric, giving it a soft, bumpy texture. It is worked by alternating rows of knit stitches and purl stitches, typically with a simple pattern of knitting one row and purling the next. This creates raised ridges on the right side of the fabric, while the wrong side remains smooth. Perl Ridge stitch is commonly used in scarves, blankets, and other accessories, providing a subtle texture that adds visual interest without being too bulky. It is easy to learn and creates a cozy, cushioned fabric.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="Waffle">
            <h1>Waffle</h1>
            <p>The waffle stitch is a textured knitting pattern that creates a raised, grid-like design, resembling the appearance of a waffle. It typically involves alternating between knit and purl stitches in a specific pattern, often using a combination of knit 2, purl 2 in one row, and then shifting the pattern slightly in the following rows. The result is a thick, cushioned fabric with a distinctive, square-shaped texture. Waffle stitch is commonly used in blankets, dishcloths, and scarves, offering both visual interest and warmth due to its dense structure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="ReverseRidge">
            <h1>Reverse Ridge</h1>
            <p>The Reverse Ridge stitch is a textured knitting pattern that creates raised ridges on the wrong side of the fabric, contrasting with the smoother right side. It is typically worked by alternating knit and purl stitches in a specific sequence, often using knit stitches on the wrong side and purl stitches on the right side, or vice versa. The pattern results in a subtle, bumpy texture that provides a bit of elasticity and visual interest. Reverse Ridge stitch is often used for edges, scarves, and other accessories, offering a clean and slightly textured finish without curling at the edges.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="DiagonalSeed">
            <h1>Diagonal Seed</h1>
            <p>The Diagonal Seed stitch is a variation of the traditional seed stitch that creates a diagonal pattern of textured bumps across the fabric. It is typically worked by alternating knit and purl stitches, with the sequence shifting every few rows to form the diagonal effect. The result is a fabric with a distinctive, slanted texture that adds visual interest and dimension. Diagonal Seed stitch is often used for scarves, blankets, and garments, providing both a smooth surface and a textured, dynamic look. It's a great choice for projects where you want a subtle, yet engaging pattern.</p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <div class="section" id="WideBasketWeave">
            <h1>Wide Basket Weave</h1>
            <p>The Wide Basket Weave stitch is a textured knitting pattern that creates a thick, woven appearance resembling a basket. It is achieved by alternating blocks of knit and purl stitches, typically working several stitches in one direction (knit or purl) before switching to the other direction. The "wide" aspect refers to using larger blocks of knit and purl stitches, which creates a bolder, more pronounced woven effect compared to the standard basket weave. This stitch is often used in blankets, scarves, and sweaters, offering a cozy, durable fabric with a visually appealing, structured texture.</p>
        </div>

It typically involves working a series of knit stitches along the edge of a piece, often combined with a purl stitch or a slip stitch on alternate rows, to create a neat, clean border. This stitch prevents the edges from curling and gives a polished, structured finish. The Edge Stitch is commonly used for scarves, shawls, blankets, and the edges of garments, providing a subtle yet effective way to frame the project and enhance its overall appearance.</p>
        </div>
